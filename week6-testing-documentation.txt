WEEK 6 TESTING DOCUMENTATION - HEALTH TRACKING FEATURES
========================================================

PROJECT CHANGES FOR WEEK 6 TESTING
===================================

NO CODE CHANGES REQUIRED - All health tracking functionality was already implemented
and working correctly from previous weeks.

chnages:
**Testing Methodology:** GUI-based API testing using Postman
**Tests Covered:** Database operations, edge cases, validation, Chart.js data integration

EXISTING FEATURES TESTED:
-------------------------
1. Health Record CRUD Operations
   - POST /health - Add health records (form data)
   - GET /health/records - Retrieve health records (JSON API)
   - PUT /health/:id - Update health records
   - DELETE /health/:id - Delete health records

2. Data Validation
   - Weight validation (0.1kg - 200kg range)
   - Date validation (no future dates)
   - Required field validation
   - SQL injection protection

3. Database Integration
   - MySQL database with health_tracker table
   - Foreign key relationships (pet_id)
   - Data persistence and retrieval

4. Chart.js Integration
   - JSON data structure suitable for visualization
   - Date and numeric data formatting
   - API endpoints for chart data

TESTING METHODOLOGY
===================

Tool Used: Postman (GUI-based testing)
Benefits: No coding required, visual results, professional industry tool

TEST FILES CREATED:
-------------------
1. health-tracking-tests.json - Postman collection with all test cases

TEST CASES COVERED:
-------------------
1. Valid Data Test
   - Purpose: Verify successful health record creation
   - Method: POST request with valid weight, diet, and date
   - Expected: 200 OK or 302 Redirect to success page

2. Edge Case - Negative Weight
   - Purpose: Test validation for invalid weight values
   - Method: POST request with weight = -5
   - Expected: 400 Bad Request with validation error

3. Edge Case - Future Date
   - Purpose: Test date validation logic
   - Method: POST request with future date
   - Expected: 400 Bad Request with date error

4. Database Verification
   - Purpose: Confirm data persistence
   - Method: GET /health/records API call
   - Expected: JSON response with stored records

5. Chart.js Data Structure
   - Purpose: Verify data format for visualization
   - Method: Analyze JSON structure from API
   - Expected: Proper date and numeric data formatting

HOW TO RUN THE TESTS
====================

PREREQUISITES:
--------------
1. Node.js and npm installed
2. MySQL database running
3. Pet Care application running on http://localhost:3000
4. Postman installed (desktop or web version)

STEP-BY-STEP TESTING INSTRUCTIONS:
----------------------------------

1. START THE APPLICATION:
   npm start

2. OPEN POSTMAN:

3. CREATE A NEW COLLECTION: and add import a file 

4. import a file called health-tracking-tests.json

5. you must see 6 tests in the collection and Send and see your results

6. if you see a 200 OK response, then the test passed

7. if you see a 400 Bad Request response, then the test failed

8. if you see a 500 Internal Server Error response, then the test failed

9. if you see a 404 Not Found response, then the test failed
